# 1089. Duplicate Zeros

## Description

## Solution

Because this problem is mainly for **"in-place"** array insertion without **without using additional memory space**.

The solution i wrote is somehow likely brute-force, and thus increase time complexity to $O(N^2)$ , but with space complexity $O(N)$
