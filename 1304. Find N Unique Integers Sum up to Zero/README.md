Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: [-7,-1,1,3,4]
Explanation: These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: [-1,0,1]
Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
